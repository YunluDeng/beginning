I have put my twitter keys and google license in the secret. 

The name is the same as what it is in the code, like CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET

Before running the code, please install the Google-cloud-language, tweepy and dotenv.

Command:

  pip3 install --user --upgrade google-cloud-language
  
  pip3 install tweepy==3.10.0
  
  pip3 install python-dotenv
